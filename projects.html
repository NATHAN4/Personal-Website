                    WatWhenWhere is a web app built by a team of me and 3 others that allows University of Waterloo students to find common availabilities in their packed schedules. We are using HTML / CSS for the front end, PHP and JavaScript for the backend, and MySQL for the databases. The app also utilizes a Facebook/Google login to allow users easy and quick access to our service, removing the hassle of signing up. My role in the team has been ensuring the login system and authentication works on all pages, and writing all website backend using PHP and JavaScript. The app was launched to the public on January 4'th, 2016 and is in continued development.

                    WATiSpend is a mobile app live on both the App Store and Play Store that allows UWaterloo students to manage their meal-plan spending habits by showing spending trends and giving suggested daily limits. Stefan Pleava originally created the iOS version. After lots of requests to make the app available for Android, I teamed with Stefan and created a port for Android. The app is created in Java and XML, and the backend is done in Python and Firebase.

                    Over the summer of 2015, I started and finished development for my Android Note Manager. The Note Manager allows users to upload their school or personal notes to their cloud account and access them wherever they are, whenever they want. All notes are associated with a date, time, title, description and tags. This allows users to sort by date or relevance to a search term. The app is written in Java and XML, with web backend done in PHP and MySQL. User passwords are securely encrypted with a SHA-512 salted hash setup.

                    QuestionBot is a prank project I released in January 2016. I advertised it as a 6-month long project that utilised Machine Learning and Artifical Neural Networks to accurately answer any question the user gave it. Instead, 'QuestionBot' rejects all questions and begins to grow mad as the user asks more and more questions. Since launch, the page has seen siginificant traffic.

                    After beginning my first term at the University of Waterloo on a very rough note, I decided to begin typesetting my notes with LaTeX, something I had been meaning to learn how to do for a long time. As an incentive to typeset and maintain quality, I've put my notes up on my website for free and accumulated a somewhat-large audience. Over the first term, 1.3GB of notes were downloaded from my site. As of February 9'th, I am no longer uploading notes to make time for other projects.

                <div class="projectcontent">
                    In high-school, I created an automatic program-marker for my computer science teacher. The program worked by asking for all .java files from all students, Scanner input and expected output. It then compiled the .java files, inputted the Scanner input, checked the output against the expected output, and assigned each student a grade. The application was written in Java.
