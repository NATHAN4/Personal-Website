        <div class="projectcontent">
            I am currently working with a team of four on a web app that allows University of Waterloo students to find common availabilities in their packed schedules. We are using HTML / CSS for the front end, PHP and JavaScript for the backend, and MySQL for the databases. The app also utilizes a Facebook/Google login to allow users easy and quick access to our service, removing the hassle of signing up. My role in the team has been ensuring the login system and authentication works on all pages, and writing all website backend using PHP and JavaScript.

            Android Note Manager
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            Over the summer of 2015, I started and finished development for my Android Note Manager. The Note Manager allows users to upload their school or personal notes to their cloud account and access them wherever they are, whenever they want. All notes are associated with a date, time, title, description and tags. This allows users to sort by date or relevance to a search term. The app is written in Java and XML, with web backend done in PHP and MySQL.

            Java Grader for Teacher
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            In high-school, I created an automatic program-marker for my computer science teacher. The program worked by asking for all .java files from all students, Scanner input and expected output. It then compiled the .java files, inputted the Scanner input, checked the output against the expected output, and assigned each student a grade. The application was written in Java.

            Automated Advertising
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            In high-school, I ran a computer-repair business. I had trouble advertising my service, however, so I created my Auto-Advertiser. It automatically posts an ad on Kijiji every 'x' hours, ensuring your service is always at the top of the category. The implementation was barbarian as I created this when I was younger, so I'm planning on recreating a more efficient version some time soon. The Automated Advertiser was created in Java.
