            Introduction:
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            Now that we have the administrative stuff out of the way, we can get into Android dev. At first, Android can seem very overwhelming because if you're coming from Java, it's probably very different than anything you've ever worked with. Why are there already a billion files in your project? Why are we working in TWO different languages (XML is technically a markup), and what's the difference between Java and XML in Android? In this tutorial I'll answer all these questions, plus we'll analyze the generated Java code.
        </div>
        <div class="tutorialtitle">
            Two Languages?
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            In Android, we work with two main base languages: Java and XML. XML is for the front end design and templates. When you decide how you want your login page to be formatted, that's done in XML. Android Studio makes learning XML super easy because when you start typing, you'll find all the attribute options pop up in a nice sorted list for you!
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">Java is used for the app backend, which means everything happening under the hood in the background. When you click a button and want the app to confirm the username and password, that confirmation is done in Java. When you want to connect to a network or do anything dynamic that responds to user input, you're probably going to be using Java.
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            Before we dive into coding, let's take a quick look at the code Android Studio has generated for us.
        </div>
        <center>
            <img class="tutorialimage" title="<3" alt="<3" src="resources/07_codeexample.png" />
        </center><br/>
        <div class="tutorialtitle">
            The Java
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            Switch to the LoginActivity.java tab as shown above to see the generated code. Let's pick this apart and understand exactly what's happening here.
        </div>
        <xmp class="prettyprint">
            package com.nwoodthorpe.tutorialnotesystem;
        </xmp>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            This line defines our Java package, it works the same way as packages work in core Java. We don't have to worry about touching this.
        </div>
        <xmp class="prettyprint">
            import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
            import android.os.Bundle;
        </xmp>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            If you expand the '+' to the left of the import line, you'll see these two lines above. This is the list of the modules you're importing into your current file. Android Studio has a sweet auto-import feature which we'll see later, so we won't actually have to work with imports too much. If you ever need to do an import without Android Studio, they work the exact same way as they do in Java.
        </div>
        <xmp class="prettyprint">
            public class LoginActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
        </xmp>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            Now we are declaring our public class, which must always be named the same as our file name. Notice we are extending the <span class="inlinecode">AppCompatActivity</span> class. This class handles a lot of the Android UI stuff including the <span class="inlinecode">ActionBar</span>, which I'll explain in the XML section. If you've forgotten, we defined what an Activity is in the previous tutorial.
        </div>
        <div class="tutorialtitle">
            Overriding onCreate
        </div>
        <xmp class="prettyprint">
            @Override
            protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
                super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
                setContentView(R.layout.activity_login);
            }
        </xmp>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            First thing to notice with this segment is we're overriding the <span class="inlinecode">onCreate</span> method from <span class="inlinecode">AppCompatActivity</span>, which actually in turn overrides it from <span class="inlinecode">Activity</span>. This function runs all the code needed to make your Activity open and be functional. By overriding it, we've said "I don't like your definition of this, I'm giving you a new one to use".
        </div>
        <center>
        <img class="tutorialimage" title="What if you could take someone's house as easily as you can override a function?" alt="What if you could take someone's house as easily as you can override a function?" src="resources/08_myhouse.png" />
        </center><br/>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            If you're unfamiliar with overriding methods, This might sound like a horrible idea! <span class="inlinecode">AppCompatActivity</span> was written by Google, why would we be able to write a better version? Well all we have to do is include the line <span class="inlinecode">super.onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState);</span>, which really means "Do everything that <span class="inlinecode">AppCompatActivity</span>'s <span class="inlinecode">onCreate</span> function does. So if you're lost, what we've done so far is we've rewritten the <span class="inlinecode">onCreate</span> function and given it the exact functionality of the old one.
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            But now we can add more code after this! In essence, what we've done is allowed ourselves to add more code to the existing function that runs when the Activity is created. We don't have to remember how it all works, the important part is this: The <span class="inlinecode">onCreate</span> function is overridden in every Activity to allow you to execute any Java code that must be run as soon (or before) the Activity is shown to the user. Your code must go AFTER the <span class="inlinecode">super.onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState);</span> line.
        </div>
        <div class="tutorialtitle">
            What the heck is R
        </div>
        <xmp class="prettyprint">
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_login);
        </xmp>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            This is the last important line in the Java code we've been given. This is the function that associates your XML front end with the Java backend. What it says is "This activity is going to look like the XML layout that <span class="inlinecode">R.layout.activity_login</span> points to." 
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            It's a bit odd for Google to define a class named <span class="inlinecode">R</span>. It isn't descriptive, and it doesn't tell me anything about what it is, or what it does. <span class="inlinecode">R</span> defines the resources for a project including constants, color hexes, images, layout files, and so on. To see everything that <span class="inlinecode">R</span> provides, just type R with a dot after into Android Studio to see the menu. <span class="inlinecode">R.layout.activity_login</span> is a pointer to our XML layout named activity_login. 
        </div>
        <div class="projectcontent">
            This tutorial is getting a bit long, so I'll end it here. Next tutorial we'll explore the XML file and try to understand what the heck is going on with that. Spoiler alert: XML can be pretty confusing.
