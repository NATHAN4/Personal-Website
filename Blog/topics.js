        "Full": "<div class='blogheader'>Introduction</div><div class='blogcontent'>Hey there! Today I'll be starting a blog on my site which is something I've been meaning to do for a long time. I'll post here whenever I want to rant or talk, or when I have announcements regarding me or my website. I actually made this blog because I got bored and wanted to write up a blog framework from scratch with JavaScript. Time will tell how well this system holds.</div><div class='blogheader'>Notes</div><div class='blogcontent'>Last week, I discontinued my math note typesetting that I'd been doing since last term, and quite a few people seemed upset over this.</div><center><img class='tutorialimage' alt='People seemed pretty suprised' title='People seemed pretty suprised' src='images/021416-A.png' /></center><br/><div class='blogcontent'>I don't think I need to excuse myself and reason why I discontinued a free service, but I'll explain my reasoning anyways. The biggest factor by far was time. Sure, it's time spent reading over my notes, but some days I was spending 3-4 hours typesetting examples and theorems. I'd rather spend this time actually reviewing my notes and trying extra problems rather than glazing over the examples we did in class.</div><div class='blogcontent'>What am I going to do with this extra time? Probably waste it to be honest.</div><div class='blogheader'>Reading Week</div><div class='blogcontent'>Right now me and all the undergrads at UW have a week off for reading week. I hate it.</div><div class='blogcontent'>I used to love having free time. I could sit back and watch a movie, or play some old video games, or go for a 6 hour walk across town. But Waterloo has changed me. Here, I always have an assignment due the next day or a midterm to study for or a paper to finish(start) writing. It's non-stop work, and I love it. I've learned to thrive on chaos and heavy workloads.</div><div class='blogcontent'>There's also a very competitive nature here at Waterloo that further encourages productivity. We have some really awesome companies hiring co-ops from here, but the top spots go to the top students: The students who have the best side projects and the best work experience. Because of this, the students constantly look for ways to get ahead of the game. If you're resting, everyone else is getting a lead on you. For anyone with a competitive spirit, that's unacceptable.</div><div class='blogcontent'>We finally have a week of peace, but I've forgotten what that's like. I'd like to relax this week, but I can't. If I try to watch a movie, or play a game, or go for a walk, I have a constant nagging thought in the back of my head telling me I could be doing something way more productive right now. I wanted to watch a movie, but that's two hours that I could spend starting a side project, or starting my math assignment, or studying for calculus. Why would I watch a movie?</div><div class='blogcontent'>It's a strange problem and it's tricky to describe. I feel like a rich man complaining about having too much money to be honest. Hopefully I'm able to find a nice balance between work and relaxation that doesn't stress me out too much.</div><div class='blogheader'>Conclusion</div><div class='blogcontent'>That's enough ranting for one day, I should get back to doing other things. As always, send me any feedback you have via facebook or my email by clicking the contact button. Thanks for stopping by :)</div>"
